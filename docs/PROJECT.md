# PROJECT.md — career-ops-ui

> The "what / why / for whom" of this project. Loaded by GSD at the start of every planning session. Update when the mission, audience, or scope changes — not for routine engineering work.

## What

**`career-ops-ui`** is a single-page web interface for the [`Fighter90/career-ops`](https://github.com/Fighter90/career-ops) AI job-search pipeline. It runs as an Express server bound to `127.0.0.1:4317`, reads the user's career-ops project (CV, applications tracker, reports, pipeline, portals), and exposes a CRM-style UI for browsing, scanning, evaluating, and tracking job offers without leaving the browser.

It is **purely additive** — nothing inside `career-ops/` changes when this UI is dropped in. The user's customizations (`cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/*`) remain authoritative.

## Why

The parent career-ops system stores its state in plain Markdown / YAML across many files. That works inside Claude Code (where the agent navigates filesystems trivially) but is hostile to humans:

- Pasting a JD URL means switching to a terminal and editing `data/pipeline.md`.
- Reading a report means opening Markdown in an editor.
- Triggering a scan means knowing which `.mjs` script to run with which flags.
- Tracker drift, missing PDFs, broken status values are invisible until something fails.

`career-ops-ui` collapses all of that into a single web tab: live SSE scan logs, side-by-side CV markdown editor, one-click doctor / verify / dedup, an interactive pipeline preview, and a tracker that reads/writes the same canonical Markdown files.

## For whom

- **Primary audience:** career-ops users who already have it set up, prefer a UI over a terminal for daily use, and want a faster glance at "what's in flight, what scored well, what's next."
- **Secondary audience:** open-source contributors who fork career-ops and want a starting point for a custom pipeline UI.

The UI is **single-tenant by design** — it binds to loopback by default, has no auth, and assumes the operator owns both the machine and the parent career-ops project.

## Scope

### In scope

- Reading and rendering all career-ops state (cv, profile, portals, applications, reports, pipeline, JDs, scan history, follow-ups, interview-prep, output PDFs).
- Triggering parent-project scripts (`scan.mjs`, `doctor.mjs`, `verify-pipeline.mjs`, `normalize-statuses.mjs`, `dedup-tracker.mjs`, `merge-tracker.mjs`, `generate-pdf.mjs`, `check-liveness.mjs`, `gemini-eval.mjs`) via buffered or SSE-streaming endpoints.
- In-process portal scanners — **93 adapters**: 88 EN-region (Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever / Workable / SmartRecruiters / Workday + RSS, the v1.75.0 aggregators RemoteOK / Remotive / Working Nomads / IBM / Arbeitsagentur / Glints / Jobstreet · SEEK, the v1.76.0 per-tenant ATSes BambooHR / Breezy HR / Comeet / Personio / Recruitee / SolidJobs, the v1.79.0 board-wide RSS feed We Work Remotely, the v1.80.0 per-tenant ATS Teamtailor, and the v1.81.0 parent-parity batch — board-wide Arbeitnow / Himalayas / Jobicy / Landing.jobs / 4 Day Week / The Muse / The Hub / Jobspresso / Hacker News, the Poland boards JustJoin.it / NoFluffJobs, and the per-tenant ATSes Pinpoint / Rippling, the v1.82.0 board-wide RSS feed NoDesk, and the v1.87.0 parent-parity batch — board-wide Get on Board and per-tenant Amazon / Avature / SAP SuccessFactors, the v1.97.0 Dassault Systèmes Exalead source, the v1.117.0 parity batch — beesite / HigherEdJobs / JibeApply / softgarden, and the v1.118.0 parity batch — Cornerstone OnDemand / Phenom / Radancy / Deutsche Bahn / EchoJobs / TKMS / Heckler & Koch / Rheinmetall / LaraJobs, plus Lever EU tenancy detection, the v1.119.0 parity batch — Meituan / Tencent, the Chinese tech boards’ zero-auth JSON APIs, the v1.123.0 Oracle Recruiting Cloud source, the v1.124.0 parity batch — Welcome to the Jungle / Agentic Jobs / Jobvite / Gem / Alibaba, the v1.127.0 parity batch — Flowxtra / VDAB / iCIMS, the v1.130.0 parity batch — a16z Speedrun / Cryptocurrency Jobs, the v1.134.0 getManfred board-wide feed — Spanish/EU tech, salaries published, the v1.135.0 parity batch — JOIN / Getro / Consider / JOINUP / Remotli (zero-auth VC-portfolio + Swiss boards), the v1.136.0 Eightfold AI talent-acquisition source, and the Swiss-native JobCloud-family / Swiss Confederation / Jobs Switzerland sources) + 5 RU portals (hh.ru / Habr Career / Trudvsem / GetMatch / GeekJob). All bypass Playwright. Discoverable via `GET /api/scan/sources`. Since v1.69.0 (P-14) the source registry auto-discovers a `<slug>.mjs` with a `meta` export for the dropdown — but a fetchable EN board ALSO needs an adapter under `server/lib/portals/adapters/<slug>.mjs` in `ALL_ADAPTERS` (the two-registry rule). The seven v1.75.0 aggregators are selected by an explicit `provider:` field; the config-driven four (IBM / Arbeitsagentur / Glints / Jobstreet · SEEK) read a per-entry `<provider>:` block threaded through as `opts.company`; the six v1.76.0 per-tenant ATSes auto-detect from the `careers_url` host (or, for Comeet, an explicit `api:` URL). A `trust_filter` block (v1.76.0, parent career-ops v1.13.0) annotates each posting with a trust score/level/flags without dropping it; the `#/scan` table no longer caps stored results (`MAX_STORED_RESULTS` removed) and pages through everything. v1.78.0 adds a client-side **country filter** to `#/scan` (`public/js/lib/countries.js`): a flagged country dropdown built from the countries detected across results (free-text location → ISO country + flag), so the user can keep only roles tied to a country alongside the Remote/Hybrid/Onsite work-type filter. v1.80.0 adds **source quarantine** (`server/lib/scan-quarantine.mjs`: a source returning a permanent 404/410 is recorded in `data/scan-quarantine.json` and skipped on later scans, self-healing after 14 days), an optional **per-source cap** (`opts.maxPerSource`, ∞ by default), and three `#/scan` client features (`public/js/lib/scan-prefs.js`): a **Posted within** age filter, **saved searches** + **★ favorites** persisted in `localStorage` with defensive validation (corrupt cache resets cleanly). v1.83.0 (parent career-ops v1.15.0) adds a **repost / ghost-posting detector** (`server/lib/detect-reposts.mjs` + `server/lib/role-matcher.mjs`): the read-only `GET /api/scan/reposts` clusters company+role rows from `data/scan-history.tsv` that were re-listed under *different* URLs within a rolling 90-day window (fuzzy role-title match), surfaced as a 🔁 collapsible panel on `#/scan`. It is an analysis feature over scan history — **not** a new source (registry stays 41 adapters). v1.84.0 (parent #1201/#1017) adds a **re-apply cooldown** (`server/lib/cooldown.mjs`): the EN scan skips roles at companies you applied to recently — configured per-company in `config/profile.yml::re_apply_windows` (`last_apply_date` / `same_role_days` / `applied_to` / optional `cross_role_bucket`; off when unset, logged as `Cooldown skipped: N`) — and persists each offer's **salary** as an optional `url | <comp>` column in `data/pipeline.md` (the URL stays the dedup key; the column is stripped on read, the cell is injection-sanitized).
- A live "Run" pathway via Anthropic / Gemini SDKs when the user provides an API key, or a copy-paste prompt path when no key is present.
- i18n across 17 locales (en, es, pt-BR, ko, ja, ru, zh-CN, zh-TW, fr, pl, uk, da, ar, de, it, tr, hi).

### Out of scope

- Multi-user deployment, authentication, RBAC, multi-tenancy.
- A bundler / build step (Vite, Webpack) — the SPA stays as plain `<script>` tags.
- TypeScript adoption (revisit only if the codebase exceeds ~10k LOC).
- Any write to the parent career-ops project that wasn't initiated by an explicit user click.

## Constraints

- **Loopback by default.** When `HOST=0.0.0.0`, the server hardens with CSP — but the UI is still un-authenticated and assumes a trusted LAN.
- **Node ≥ 18.** No polyfills below.
- **Three production deps.** `express`, `js-yaml`, and `multer`. Adding a third needs a spec.
- **CSP excludes `unsafe-inline` from `script-src`.** Every event handler is `addEventListener`. This must remain.
- **Parent project layout discovery.** `CAREER_OPS_ROOT` env, then `..`, then `cwd()`. The UI must keep working under all three.

## Success criteria

- A user can run `bash bin/start.sh` from a fresh clone and reach a usable dashboard in under 60 seconds. ✅ verified 2026-05-08.
- 100 % of user-facing actions work without an API key (manual prompt fallback). ✅ all `/api/*` endpoints fall through to a prompt-text response when no key is set.
- Test coverage stays ≥80 % line / ≥75 % branch. ✅ ~93 % line / ~83 % branch as of v1.8.0.
- No security regression: every PR passes `web-ui-route-reviewer` and `spa-view-reviewer`. ✅ subagent definitions live under `.claude/agents/`.
- Live LLM execution paths (`/api/deep`, `/api/mode/:slug`) deliver grounded output (cv + profile + mode templates inlined). ✅ verified 2026-05-08 against `claude-sonnet-4-6` — 26 KB markdown returned for a deep-research call.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Parent project** | The career-ops repo that this UI sits inside. Owns all user data. |
| **Live mode** | Backend executes prompts via Anthropic / Gemini SDK (key required). |
| **Manual mode** | Backend returns the assembled prompt as text; user pastes it elsewhere. |
| **Mode** | A prompt template under `modes/<slug>.md` in the parent (`oferta`, `deep`, `interview-prep`, `contacto`, `apply`, …). |
| **Tracker** | `data/applications.md` — the canonical Markdown table of every offer the user has seen. |
| **Pipeline** | `data/pipeline.md` — the inbox of pending JD URLs. |
| **Report** | A Markdown file under `reports/` produced by `oferta` mode evaluation. |

## Versioning

`package.json::version` is the source of truth. The footer renders it via `/api/health.version`. The parent's `VERSION` file is reported separately as `parentVersion` — they evolve independently. Use semver: breaking SPA contracts bump major, new endpoints / views bump minor, fixes bump patch.
