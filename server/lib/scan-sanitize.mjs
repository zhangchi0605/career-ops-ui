/**
 * Scan-write sanitizers (v1.75.0).
 *
 * Job postings come from external feeds (Greenhouse, RemoteOK, Glints, …).
 * Their title / company / location strings are attacker-influenced data that
 * the scanners persist into two on-disk formats:
 *
 *   • data/scan-history.tsv  — tab-separated rows, one per posting
 *   • data/pipeline.md       — pending URLs (legacy fenced list or markdown checklist)
 *
 * Without sanitization a posting whose company name contains a newline could
 * inject a whole extra TSV row, and a value beginning with `= + - @` becomes a
 * live formula when the TSV is opened in a spreadsheet. The control-character
 * class here is deliberately broad (`\r\n\t` plus the vertical tab, form feed,
 * and the Unicode line/paragraph separators), so any record/line separator a
 * viewer might honor is collapsed.
